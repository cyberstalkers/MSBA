Capstone Project
---  
**Project Description**  
This business analytics projects uses real-world data and allows students to perform workflow management, strategy setting, model building, data analysis, interpretation, and result presentation.

Due to the confidentiality agreement, specific data of the project cannot be disclosed.  
Some general tools designed for data processing and model framework are shared here.

**Content**  
*Optimization_Model.Rmd* : Framework for solving convex optimization based on the package Rdonlp2. Although all the parameters are faked here, it can be applied to optimization problems with multiple situations, by replacing the original independent variables and constraints with yours.

*Additional_temperature_API.py*: A program to obtain historical temperature data through a free API called [Nowapi](https://www.nowapi.com/api/weather.history). Note that data extraction only allows 200 times/h.  

*Temperature Model_Neural Network.py*: A RNN algoritm to simulate the missing temperature data, based on the existing and reference ones.

***Again, specific data of the project is not disclosed. Only general frameworks here.***
